When the RESTful Web Service is deployed, the SWoT_NFC project can be imported on Eclipse.

Make sure to set the correct IP address of the server running the REST web service.
(e.g. private final  String SERVER  = "192.168.1.2"; 

When using a NFC phone with a tag, just scan the tag and you'll be redirected to the app.

If you don't have a NFC phone, you can still use the simulator inside the app.

The scanned tags (real or fake) can be viewed from the app in the "Display" tab.
